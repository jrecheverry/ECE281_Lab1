#Results

The simulated results do match my truth table above. The tests simulated by the testbench served to mimmick the signals given off from the truth table. When doing the acutal truth table, we had to convert the outputs to 2's complement. The circuit inputs were input in binary and ranged from values 0 to 7, while the outputs converted the input into 2's complement and the values ranged from -4 to 3.
