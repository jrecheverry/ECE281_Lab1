#Results

The simulated results do match my truth table above. The tests simulated by the testbench served to mimmick the signals given off from the truth table. When doing the acutal truth table, we had to convert the outputs to 2's complement. The circuit inputs were input in binary and ranged from values 0 to 7, while the outputs converted the input into 2's complement and the values ranged from -4 to 3.

#Main Lab
during the main lab, we implemented a .ucf file and then tested it on our Nexys 2 chip
  
#Debugging
I ran into an issue on the first iteration for creating the .ucf file because i needed to attin the propper license. After aquiring the proper license, the file was successfully created. I did not run into any other debugging issues.
